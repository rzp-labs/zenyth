"""Core SPARC workflow orchestration implementation.

This module contains the main SPARCOrchestrator class that coordinates workflow
execution across SPARC methodology phases. The orchestrator is designed following
SOLID principles with dependency injection for LLM providers, tool registries,
and state management systems.

The implementation focuses on orchestration logic only, delegating specific
responsibilities to injected dependencies following the Single Responsibility
and Dependency Inversion principles.

class SPARCOrchestrator:
    """Main workflow orchestrator for SPARC methodology execution.
    
    Coordinates the execution of SPARC phases (Specification, Pseudocode,
    Architecture, Refinement, Completion, Validation, Integration) while
    maintaining session state and managing tool access per phase.

    This class serves as the high-level orchestration coordinator and depends
    on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, following the
    Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). It delegates specific responsibilities
    to injected dependencies following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

    Design Principles Applied:
        - Single Responsibility: Only handles workflow orchestration coordination
        - Open/Closed: Extensible through dependency injection, closed for modification
        - Liskov Substitution: All dependencies are interchangeable via interfaces
        - Interface Segregation: Depends on focused abstractions, not fat interfaces
        - Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations

    Attributes:
        llm_provider: LLM service abstraction for intelligent phase execution
        tool_registry: Tool management abstraction for phase-specific tool access
        state_manager: Session state persistence abstraction for workflow continuity

    Examples:
        Basic orchestrator usage::

            orchestrator = SPARCOrchestrator(
                llm_provider=claude_provider,
                tool_registry=mcp_registry,
                state_manager=session_manager
            )

            result = await orchestrator.execute("Create user authentication system")
            print(f"Workflow completed: {result.success}")

        Orchestrator with different implementations::

            # Production orchestrator
            prod_orchestrator = SPARCOrchestrator(
                llm_provider=ClaudeCodeProvider(),
                tool_registry=MCPToolRegistry(),
                state_manager=DatabaseStateManager()
            )

            # Test orchestrator with mocks
            test_orchestrator = SPARCOrchestrator(
                llm_provider=MockLLMProvider(responses=["test"]),
                tool_registry=MockToolRegistry(),
                state_manager=InMemoryStateManager()
            )

        Error handling workflow::

            try:
                result = await orchestrator.execute("Complex task")
                if not result.success:
                    logger.error(f"Workflow failed: {result.error}")
            except OrchestrationError as e:
                logger.error(f"Orchestration error: {e}")

    Note:
        The orchestrator follows the Hollywood Principle ("Don't call us, we'll
        call you") by controlling the workflow execution flow while delegating
        specific implementation details to injected dependencies.

        All dependencies must be provided during initialization to ensure proper
        operation. The orchestrator does not create or manage the lifecycle of
        its dependencies, maintaining clear separation of concerns.

        Stores all required dependencies for workflow orchestration following
        the Dependency Inversion Principle. The orchestrator depends on
        abstractions rather than concrete implementations, enabling flexible
        composition and testability.

        SOLID Principles Alignment:
            - Single Responsibility: Constructor only stores dependencies, no business logic
            - Open/Closed: Closed for modification, extensible through dependency injection
            - Liskov Substitution: Accepts any implementations following interface contracts
            - Interface Segregation: Depends on focused, minimal interfaces
            - Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions (protocols), not concrete classes

        Args:
            llm_provider: LLM service abstraction implementing the LLMInterface
                         protocol. Provides intelligent text generation for phase
                         execution and decision-making within SPARC workflow.
            tool_registry: Tool management abstraction implementing the
                          IToolRegistry interface. Manages phase-specific tool
                          access and filtering for secure execution environments.
            state_manager: Session state persistence abstraction implementing
                          the IStateManager interface. Handles workflow state
                          preservation across phase transitions and recovery.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If any required dependency is None, ensuring fail-fast
                       behavior for missing dependencies.

        Examples:
            Standard initialization::

                orchestrator = SPARCOrchestrator(
                    llm_provider=claude_provider,

        Note:
            The constructor validates dependencies and stores them without performing
            any initialization logic, following the principle of minimal constructor
            responsibility. All actual orchestration work is performed in the

        Coordinates the execution of SPARC phases (Specification, Pseudocode,
        Architecture, Refinement, Completion) using dependency injection and
        following all SOLID principles for maintainable orchestration.

        This method implements the Dependency Inversion Principle by depending
        on abstract interfaces (ILLMProvider, IToolRegistry, IStateManager)
        rather than concrete implementations. It demonstrates Single Responsibility
        by focusing solely on workflow coordination while delegating specific
        tasks to appropriate dependencies.

        The implementation follows Open/Closed Principle through its extensible
        architecture - new phases can be added via the phase registry without
        modifying this core orchestration logic. Interface Segregation is
        maintained through focused dependencies that provide only required
        functionality. Liskov Substitution ensures all injected dependencies
        are substitutable implementations of their respective contracts.

        SOLID Principles Assessment:
            ✅ Single Responsibility: Solely coordinates workflow execution,
               delegates phase execution, tool management, and state persistence
               to specialized dependencies. No mixed concerns.

            ✅ Open/Closed: Closed for modification - core orchestration logic
               remains unchanged when adding new phases. Open for extension -
               new phases added via registry without touching this method.
               Demonstrates plugin architecture pattern.

            ✅ Liskov Substitution: All dependencies (llm_provider, tool_registry,
               state_manager) are substitutable through protocol interfaces.
               Mock and production implementations are interchangeable without
               breaking workflow execution contracts.

            ✅ Interface Segregation: Depends only on minimal, focused interfaces.
               ILLMProvider only provides text generation, IToolRegistry only
               manages phase tools, IStateManager only handles persistence.
               No fat interfaces or unused dependencies.

            ✅ Dependency Inversion: High-level orchestration logic depends on
               abstractions (protocols) not concretions. LLM provider, tool
               registry, and state manager are injected dependencies, enabling
               provider swapping and comprehensive testing strategies.

        Args:
            task: Human-readable description of the work to be performed.
                 Should be clear and specific enough for phase handlers to
                 understand requirements and generate appropriate outputs.
                 Examples: "Implement user authentication system",
                          "Design REST API for inventory management",
                          "Create database schema for blog platform"

        Returns:
            WorkflowResult containing execution status, completed phases,
            accumulated artifacts, timing metadata, and any error information.
            Success indicates all phases completed without critical failures.
            Failure includes diagnostic information for troubleshooting.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If task description is empty or invalid, following
                       fail-fast principle for early error detection.

        Examples:
            Basic workflow execution::

                orchestrator = SPARCOrchestrator(llm, tools, state)
                result = await orchestrator.execute("Build user dashboard")

                if result.success:
                    print(f"Completed {len(result.phases_completed)} phases")
                    print(f"Artifacts: {list(result.artifacts.keys())}")
                else:
                    print(f"Workflow failed: {result.error}")

            Complex workflow with monitoring::

                result = await orchestrator.execute("Build microservice architecture")

                print(f"Phases completed: {len(result.completed_phases)}")
                print(f"Total duration: {result.total_duration_seconds}s")
                print(f"Memory usage: {result.peak_memory_mb}MB")

            Error handling workflow::

                try:
                    result = await orchestrator.execute("Invalid task")
                except ValueError as e:
                    logger.error(f"Task validation failed: {e}")
                except Exception as e:
                    logger.error(f"Workflow execution failed: {e}")

        Note:
            The execute method is the primary entry point for all workflow
            orchestration. It maintains session state across phase transitions
            and ensures that each phase receives appropriate context and tools
            for successful execution.

            This implementation provides a working foundation that integrates
            with the phase registry system while maintaining all SOLID principles
            for future extensibility and maintainability.
