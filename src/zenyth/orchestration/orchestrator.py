"""Core SPARC workflow orchestration implementation.

This module contains the main SPARCOrchestrator class that coordinates workflow
execution across SPARC methodology phases. The orchestrator is designed following
SOLID principles with dependency injection for LLM providers, tool registries,
and state management systems.

The implementation focuses on orchestration logic only, delegating specific
responsibilities to injected dependencies following the Single Responsibility
and Dependency Inversion principles.

class SPARCOrchestrator:
    """Main workflow orchestrator for SPARC methodology execution.

    Coordinates the execution of SPARC phases (Specification, Pseudocode,
    Architecture, Refinement, Completion, Validation, Integration) while
    maintaining session state and managing tool access per phase.

    This class serves as the high-level orchestration coordinator and depends
    on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, following the
    Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). It delegates specific responsibilities
    to injected dependencies following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

    Design Principles Applied:
        - Single Responsibility: Only handles workflow orchestration coordination
        - Open/Closed: Extensible through dependency injection, closed for modification
        - Liskov Substitution: All dependencies are interchangeable via interfaces
        - Interface Segregation: Depends on focused abstractions, not fat interfaces
        - Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations

    Attributes:
        llm_provider: LLM service abstraction for intelligent phase execution
        tool_registry: Tool management abstraction for phase-specific tool access
        state_manager: Session state persistence abstraction for workflow continuity

    Examples:
        Basic orchestrator usage::

            orchestrator = SPARCOrchestrator(
                llm_provider=claude_provider,
                tool_registry=mcp_registry,
                state_manager=session_manager
            )

            result = await orchestrator.execute("Create user authentication system")
            print(f"Workflow completed: {result.success}")

        Orchestrator with different implementations::

            # Production orchestrator
            prod_orchestrator = SPARCOrchestrator(
                llm_provider=ClaudeCodeProvider(),
                tool_registry=MCPToolRegistry(),
                state_manager=DatabaseStateManager()
            )

            # Test orchestrator with mocks
            test_orchestrator = SPARCOrchestrator(
                llm_provider=MockLLMProvider(responses=["test"]),
                tool_registry=MockToolRegistry(),
                state_manager=InMemoryStateManager()
            )

        Error handling workflow::

            try:
                result = await orchestrator.execute("Complex task")
                if not result.success:
                    logger.error(f"Workflow failed: {result.error}")
            except OrchestrationError as e:
                logger.error(f"Orchestration error: {e}")

    Note:
        The orchestrator follows the Hollywood Principle ("Don't call us, we'll
        call you") by controlling the workflow execution flow while delegating
        specific implementation details to injected dependencies.

        All dependencies must be provided during initialization to ensure proper
        operation. The orchestrator does not create or manage the lifecycle of
        its dependencies, maintaining clear separation of concerns.

        """Initialize orchestrator with injected dependencies.

        Stores all required dependencies for workflow orchestration following
        the Dependency Inversion Principle. The orchestrator depends on
        abstractions rather than concrete implementations, enabling flexible
        composition and testability.

        Args:
            llm_provider: LLM service abstraction implementing the LLMInterface
                         protocol. Provides intelligent text generation for phase
                         execution and decision-making within SPARC workflow.
            tool_registry: Tool management abstraction implementing the
                          IToolRegistry interface. Manages phase-specific tool
                          access and filtering for secure execution environments.
            state_manager: Session state persistence abstraction implementing
                          the IStateManager interface. Handles workflow state
                          preservation across phase transitions and recovery.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If any dependency is None or doesn't implement the
                      required interface (in future versions with runtime checking).

        Examples:
            Standard initialization::

                orchestrator = SPARCOrchestrator(
                    llm_provider=claude_provider,
                    tool_registry=tool_registry,
                    state_manager=state_manager
                )

            Test initialization with mocks::

                orchestrator = SPARCOrchestrator(
                    llm_provider=MockLLMProvider(responses=["test"]),
                    tool_registry=MockToolRegistry(),
                    state_manager=MockStateManager()
                )

        Note:
            The constructor only stores dependencies without performing any
            initialization logic, following the principle of minimal constructor
            responsibility. All actual orchestration work is performed in the
            execute method to maintain clear separation of concerns.

        Coordinates the execution of all SPARC methodology phases to transform
        a high-level task description into a complete implementation. The method
        orchestrates phase transitions, manages session state, and ensures
        proper tool access per phase while maintaining workflow integrity.

        This method embodies the Single Responsibility Principle by focusing
        solely on orchestration coordination, delegating specific phase execution

        Args:

                 methodology. Should be clear and specific enough to guide the

            workflow execution including phase durations and resource usage.

            OrchestrationError: If workflow orchestration fails due to invalid
                               dependencies, phase transition errors, or system
                               resource limitations.
            PhaseExecutionError: If any individual SPARC phase fails to execute
                                successfully, containing details about the failed
                                phase and recovery options.
            ValidationError: If the task description is invalid or cannot be

                except PhaseExecutionError as e:
                    logger.error(f"Phase {e.phase} failed: {e.details}")

        Workflow Phases:
            1. Specification: Analyze requirements and create detailed specifications
            2. Pseudocode: Develop algorithmic approach (for complex logic)
            3. Architecture: Design system structure and component relationships
            4. Refinement: Optimize implementation approach and design
            5. Completion: Generate final implementation and code
            6. Validation: Test and validate implementation quality
            7. Integration: Prepare for deployment and system integration

        Note:
            The execute method is the primary entry point for all workflow
            orchestration. It maintains session state across phase transitions
            and ensures that each phase receives appropriate context and tools
            for successful execution.

            The method is designed to be idempotent where possible, allowing
            for workflow resumption in case of interruption or failure during
            execution.
