"""Test suite for SPARC orchestration components.

This module validates the behavior of the core orchestration system that manages
SPARC workflow execution. The orchestrator coordinates phase transitions, manages
session state, and integrates with LLM providers and tool registries following
the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

Following TDD methodology, these tests drive the implementation of orchestration
classes that adhere to SOLID principles while providing deterministic, testable
workflow management for homelab automation scenarios.

Test Strategy:
    - Verify orchestrator implements proper dependency injection
    - Test SPARC phase execution workflow coordination
    - Validate session state management and persistence
    - Ensure proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
    - Test tool registry integration and phase-based filtering
    - Verify workflow event handling and monitoring

Examples:
    Running orchestrator tests::

        pytest tests/unit/test_orchestrator.py -v

    Running with coverage::

        pytest tests/unit/test_orchestrator.py --cov=zenyth.orchestration --cov-report=term-missing
